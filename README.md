# magplot

A very simple Python library to draw magnetic field lines from the bottom boundary in a 3D Cartesian box using [PyVista](https://github.com/pyvista/pyvista). There is a notebook in the `example` folder which explains how to use it.

## Installation
```
pip install git+https://github.com/mgjeon/magnetic_field_line.git
